# sentimentalanalyisis
There are two main python files in which sentimental analysis of a given essay is performed, one of the file uses NLTK tool and other is without it.
The results are then visualized using matplotlib.
Using NLTK tool I've classified sentiments as positive and negative.![graphforsentimentalanalysis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83823188/231425505-3bfb4261-7fd7-4634-ad62-bc6fcfd01c75.png)
